This is just a test post. This first part is supposed to be the excerpt, and hopefully the text after the separator will not be shown on the blog page. 

<!--more-->

This is the main content after the excerpt. I don't want to see this on the main blog page. I have used a random image from my B.Tech Final Project as the featured image, because why not. I have also tried to justify the text in the content, but to see if it has been correctly justified, I need to asdd many more words. So all this is just rubbish chatter just to increase the word count. Okay yes, the text does seem to be justified correctly. I do like this theme. It seems the well made theme combined with my added motivation to work on the website has enabled me to make quick progress.
